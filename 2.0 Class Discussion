SELECT title, AVG(rating) FROM movies WHERE genre = ‘Action’ GROUP BY title, rating




df.filter("genre = 'Action'").groupBy("title", "rating").agg(df("title"), avg("rating")).show()


Step 1 - Filter what you need

Step 2 - Apply Group by and aggregate and Average on what comes out of filter.

In a traditional database system
Now imagine that movies genre is Action, drama, fiction and also for all the years. Now think of the volume of data if we have to scan each time
someone is on movie streaming website, we have to scan each and every record, to speed up indexes may be applied.

What are the solutions?

Partition the data based on the kind of query runs across the storage
Say if we have patitions based on year and say we have records for last 80 years
Now think if we can parallely search all the 80 partitions, it will be 80 times faster
